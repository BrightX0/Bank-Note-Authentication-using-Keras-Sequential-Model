# Bank-Note-Authentication-using-Keras-Sequential-Model
This article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.  Artificial Neural Networks can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Keras is an open-source library that can be used to implement artificial neural networks in Keras. Keras has all the major features required to build and train artificial neural networks. We shall be using Keras Sequential Model to authenticate banknotes. The dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning. The dataset has information extracted from real and forged banknotes. The features from the images have been extracted using a Wavelet Transform tool.
